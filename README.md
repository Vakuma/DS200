The script barplot.py generates bar plot for the custom revenues of machinery from 2006 to 2014.
We can see that the revenues are steadily increasing over the years.

The script scatterplot.py plots the custom revenue of fruits(x-axis) versus the custom revenues of electrical machinery(y-axis).
Intitially there is no correlation between these revenues as expected.
But during later years there is strong correlation between the revenues. This is surprising and needs to be investigated further.


The script boxplot.py plots the box plots of revuenes of various metals over the years.
The legend is 
1.Iron & Steel
2.Non-ferrous metals
3.Copper
4.Zinc
5.Aluminium

From the plots we see that Iron and steel are the most revnue generating while Zinc is the least revenue generating metal from custom duties.
